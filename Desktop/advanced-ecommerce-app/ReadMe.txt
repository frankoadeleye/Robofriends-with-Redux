The project goes thus: (by Frank O. Adeleye)
First we create our component in src folder and we name it homepage.component.jsx or '.js', and we make it a functional component since we are going to be using state in this component; for the same reason we also wouldn't have to  use the render() method;
Now we are going to include sass to our project by:
                    npm install --save node-sass
Then we make another file called homepage.styles.scss, and we style. Then import to our homepage.component.jsx
